	<div>I did this video because I was bored moving around the city 5 days a week, 12 hours a day. I created using adobe premiere the process of getting this done took about a couple of weeks of filming and 30 Minutes of editing it and it turned out to be a success. All the footage i gathered and mixed together flowed nicely with the song and the end result is the video above</div>

	<br> In this project I used the Boomerage app and Adobe Premiere.  <br/> <img src="boomerang.jpg">
